# How To Navigate the Website

The landing page will include a brief overview of the project.

[Installation](https://webcomponents.ucla.edu/build/1.0.0-beta.7/docs/installation/download.html) and [Contribution](https://webcomponents.ucla.edu/build/1.0.0-beta.7/docs/contribute/contributing.html) notes are also included on the webpage.

These sections are broken down on the left-side menu.
