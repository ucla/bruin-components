# :school_satchel: :nut_and_bolt: UCLA Web Components Library

Welcome to the UCLA Web Component Library.

The digital application of UCLA’s brand can be found here. We’ve developed a library of components, along with thoughtfully articulated guidelines, documentation, and code to assist campus partners in designing and developing robust and accessible experiences across all UCLA websites and applications.

Our goal is to provide flexible resources and tools for any person or team who contributes to UCLA’s diverse and substantial digital infrastructure.

**Project Built with:** [Fractal Component Library](https://fractal.build/)

**Maintained By:** Strategic Communications
