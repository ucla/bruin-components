title: Visual Design Criteria
---

The following is how a component proposal or enhancement will be evaluated for visual design for inclusion in the component library.

### Color:

- Does the component use the color palette already developed? If not, suggest alternatives from the color palette.
- re any new colors used in a case where an existing color could work just as well instead? If yes, suggest alternatives from the color palette.
- Does the component over emphasize a non-brand color without a functional need? If yes, suggest alternatives with a brand color.
Do all color combinations meet Level AA WCAG 2.0 compliance? If not, suggest changing color combinations to be compliant.

### Typography:

- Does the component use the font stack: Helvetica, Arial, San Serif?  If not, require fonts to be changed.
Does the component use the type styles already developed? If not, recommend type styles from the library that can be used instead.
- Are any new type styles used in a case where an existing type style could work just as well instead? If yes, recommend type styles from the library that can be used instead.

### Layout:
- Does spacing fall within our 8pt grid? If not, recommend change spacing to values that fall within the 8pt grid.
- Can the component fit into our 12 column grid? If not, recommend change sizing to values that fall within the 12 column grid.
- Does the use of white space feel consistent with our “open” and “optimistic” look and feel? If not, recommend increasing white space in design.
- Is the use of overlapping elements consistent with our “energetic” and “progressive” look and feel? If not, recommend a solution to making overlapping elements consistent.

### Interaction:
- Are buttons, links, form elements and other interactive and input elements consistent with those already developed? If not, require buttons, links, and form elements to follow guidelines from the library.
- Are default, hover, active, focus, and disabled states consistent with our Interactive color sheet? If not, require states to conform to guidelines from the library.
- Do any new interactive elements meet Level AA WCAG 2.0 compliance for clear visual clarity? If not, recommend a solution to changing the elements to be Level AA compliant.
