title: Design criteria
---

The following is how a designed component proposal or enhancement will be evaluated for inclusion in the component library.

### Utility

- Is this pattern widely used on campus websites, products, and services?
- Does this pattern support a common task, user need, or use case?
- Does it provide a more user-centered approach to an existing pattern?
- Can it be extended to support similar use cases?


### Color:

- Does the component use the color palette already developed?
- Are any new colors used in a case where an existing color could work just as well instead?
- Does the component over emphasize a non-brand color without a functional need?
- Do all color combinations meet Level AA WCAG 2.0 compliance?


### Typography:

- Does the component use the font stack: Helvetica, Arial, San Serif?
- Does the component use the type styles already developed?
- Are any new type styles used in a case where an existing type style could work just as well instead?


### Layout:
- Does spacing fall within our 8pt grid?
- Can the component fit into our 12 column grid?
- Does the use of white space feel consistent with our “open” and “optimistic” look and feel?
- Is the use of overlapping elements consistent with our “energetic” and “progressive” look and feel?


### Interaction:
- Are buttons, links, form elements and other interactive and input elements consistent with those already developed?
- Are default, hover, active, focus, and disabled states consistent with our Interactive color sheet?
- Do any new interactive elements meet contrast requirements (Level AA WCAG 2.0) for visual clarity?
- Do form components provide clearly worded validation and error messaging?
