title: Design criteria
---
The following criteria will be used to evaluate if a designed component, enhancement, or proposal should be included in the component library:
​
### Utility
[ ] Is this pattern widely used on campus websites, products, and services?
[ ] Does this pattern support a common task or use case?
[ ] Does it provide a more user-centered approach to an existing pattern, use case, or flow?
[ ] Does it align with established user interface and interaction patterns?
[ ] Does it follow usability standards?
[ ] Can it be extended to support other use cases?
​
### Color
[ ] Does the component use the official brand color palette?
[ ] Are new colors used where an existing color could work just as well instead?
[ ] Does the component over emphasize a non-brand color without a functional need?
[ ] Do all color combinations meet Level AA WCAG 2.0 compliance?
​
### Typography
[ ] Does the component use the font stack: Helvetica, Arial, San Serif?
[ ] Does the component use the type styles already developed?
[ ] Are new type styles used in a case where an existing type style could work just as well? If not, why?
​
### Layout
[ ] Does spacing fall within our 8pt grid?
[ ] Can the component fit into our 12 column grid?
[ ] Does the use of white space feel consistent with our open and optimistic look and feel?
[ ] Is the use of overlapping elements consistent with our energetic and progressive look and feel?
​
### Interaction
[ ] Are buttons, links, form elements, and other inputs consistent with those already developed? If not, why?
[ ] Are default, hover, active, focus, and disabled states consistent with our interactive color sheet?
[ ] Does each state of an interactive element meet contrast requirements (Level AA WCAG 2.0)?
[ ] Do form components provide clear validation and error states?
