## Submitting a Design Proposal or Enhancement

Contributors can submit designs for new component proposals or existing component enhancements for consideration in the library by submitting an issue on Bitbucket.

  1. To do so, go to the [UCLA Bruin Components Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/uclaucomm/ucla-bruin-components/src/campus/).
  2. Select "Issues" from the left navigation then click the "Create issue" button from the upper right hand corner.
  3. In the description, clearly state your proposal for a new component or revision to an existing component. Make sure to explain the use case and functionality for your new or revised component.
  4. Insert a .jpeg or .png of your proposal or enhancement along with your description to help illustrate your idea.
  5. Then under the "Kind" dropdown, select "enhancement" if you are suggesting a change to a current component or "proposal" if you're suggesting to add a new component.
  6. Then under the "Component" dropdown, select "Design."
  7. If available, attach the source file for your design (.psd, .xd, .sketch) or provide a cloud-hosted link (Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma).

Once you've submitted your proposal or enhancement, look out for votes and comments from the community. The comments section for an issue is also a great place to connect with other contributors who may be interested in helping with your proposal or enhancement.



## Voting and commenting

Everyone is invited and encouraged to vote for and comment on new component proposals or existing enhancements. Each issue submitted has a vote button and comment section. The comment section is a great place to connect with other contributors who may be interested in working together to help design and program.


## Selecting Proposals or Enhancements for inclusion in the Component Library

Periodically, the UCLA Web Components volunteer committee will review design submissions on Bitbucket for inclusion in the component library. The most popular submissions will be evaluated by UCLA brand design criteria (link) to ensure it will fit well among the existing components. They will look at things like color, typography, layout and interactions to ensure the submission is on [brand](https://brand.ucla.edu/), [ADA compliant](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), follows UX best practices and does not conflict with an existing style, component or pattern. Any feedback from the committee will be communicated through the comments on the issue in Bitbucket. You will be able to address the feedback and resubmit your proposal or enhancement. If the committee reviews and accepts your proposal or enhancement you'll also be notified through the comments and plans for implementing your proposal or enhancement in the component library will then be made.


## What if my proposal is not accepted?

No worries! Remember the component library is a base set of components geared towards helping you build common website patterns quickly, efficiently and on brand. It won't cover every need for every department. You are always able to add or revise components on your own websites to fit specific needs or requirements your department or division may have.
