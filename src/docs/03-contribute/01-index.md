## Core Principles

### Solving Common Problems

If you want to recommend a new feature, consider if it addresses a common use case or problem shared by other teams. There are many use cases we don't yet support . We appreciate contributions based on research and an assessment of common needs.

### Flexibility

When suggesting a new feature, think about the minimum requirements for a functional component, then specify optional add-ons. People will use similar components to address different needs and solve problems in different ways. Design and develop with flexibility in mind.

### Accessibility

ADA compliance is required legally, and as a trusted educational institute, it is our responsibility to uphold accessibility standards. All web components  must first pass an ADA compliance assessment before being merged into the official component library.

### Collaboration

This is a collaborative process. This project is built by the UCLA community for the UCLA community. When you submit a new feature or suggestion, know that other people review, refine, and build on your work. Whether you contribute thoughts, design, or code, the process is iterative and ever-evolving.

## Who Can Contribute

We are striving to improve and thoughtfully expand our library to meet the needs of campus, with a governance process for reviewing new contributions. Currently, anyone may recommend and contribute code, design, documentation, or iterations to existing work. We will review and consider community contributions that follow our 6-step process outlined below.

## Process for Contributing

### Step 1 - Search Issues

Start by searching the [open issues board](https://bitbucket.org/uclaucomm/ucla-bruin-components/issues?status=new&status=open) in our Bitbucket repository. Look for issues that align with your own suggestion or desired contribution. You can comment on an existing issue, upvote to increase its prominence, and "watch" it for future discussion or progress.

### Step 2 - Create Issue

If a shared issue does not currently exist, you can [create a new issue](https://bitbucket.org/uclaucomm/ucla-bruin-components/issues/new). We recommend submitting your contribution as a:
- **bug** to fix errors in an existing component (or documentation)
- **enhancement** to improve or add on to existing components (or documentation)
- **proposal to recommend or submit new features or components

### Step 3 - Submit Work

Process for submitting work will vary depending on what you want to contribute. Please see [Code Contributions](/docs/contribute/code-contributions) or [Design Contributions](/docs/contribute/design-contributions) for more information.

### Step 4 - Solicit Feedback

Now is the time to share your recommendation or work with other people. This is a good way to acquire feedback, partner with other people, and gather community support for an issue.

We recommend joining our [UCLA Slack](http://ucla.slack.com) channel ([#web-components](https://ucla.slack.com/archives/G01KJ3GJKHS)) to discuss ideas and contributions with our community. This is also a good way to garner upvotes on the [open issues board](https://bitbucket.org/uclaucomm/ucla-bruin-components/issues), which is one way we measure support for new features.

### Step 5 - Committee Review

If your enhancement or feature is approved for inclusion in the web components library, it will undergo review by various committees. The goal is to ensure compliance with:
- Current front-end coding standards
- Web accessibility guidelines
- Commonly accepted usability guidelines
- UCLA's visual brand guidelines
