title: Bruin Components
---
Our goal is to make it easier for teams to design and develop great experiences for users across all UCLA websites and applications.

This site is the preview and documentation part of how to use and contribute to the Bruin Components source. It's where we develop new features and not all components are always stable. For that reason you should **always** reference the latest version of official Bruin Components documentation [bruincomponents.ucla.edu](https://bruincomponents.ucla.edu/).

## What Are We Doing Here?

This is where we'll be putting our components through their pacesâ€”designing, developing, testing, and eventually distributing them as a package for designers and developers to use in their projects.

We are using [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) to build and document components for Bruin Components. Fractal is a component library generator written in Node.js.
