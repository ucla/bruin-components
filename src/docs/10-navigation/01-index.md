# **Navigation**

## Preview and navigate priority topics on your site

## **Usage**

### **Usability Guidance**

* Highlight the primary topics of your website. Help visitors understand what content they can expect to find before they start browsing your site.
* Use succinct labels of 1-2 words in length for each navigation link.
* Use universal language everyone understands.
* Consult web analytics to understand which topics matter most to your visitors.
* Prioritize the needs of site users over internal stakeholders. Navigation is for site users, not your Dean or Vice Chancellor.
* Help people find what they need rather than promoting things they don't.
* If you need to highlight things like a widely publicized report or conference, do so within the body of your website. Navigation links are intended for evergreen content.

### **Accessibility Requirements**

* Use the `<nav>` element and ARIA labels, e.g. "Main", "Footer", "Social", etc., to identify each distinct navigation menu of your site.
* Insert a hidden skip nav with quick links to different parts of your site like the main content, navigation menus, search bar, toolbar, footer, etc.
