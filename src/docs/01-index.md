## Welcome to the UCLA Web Component Library.

The foundation for UCLA’s digital brand can be found here. We’ve developed a library of components, along with thoughtfully articulated guidelines, documentation, and code to assist campus partners in designing and developing robust and accessible experiences across all UCLA websites and applications.

Our goal is to provide flexible resources and tools for any person or team who contributes to UCLA's diverse and substantial digital infrastructure.

## Why We’re Here

We want to help establish and sustain a unified brand identity across UCLA’s expansive digital properties. By keeping the digital brand consistent, we are able to provide all users a cohesive and seamless experience, no matter which UCLA family of websites they are on.

By sharing UCLA’s foundation and components, we hope to eliminate the initial barriers of production for UCLA’s digital teams, and to improve the overall efficiency and quality of that process.

## Who Should Use This

We encourage any person or team that is designing and/or developing a website or application for a UCLA entity to use this library.
