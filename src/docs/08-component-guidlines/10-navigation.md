## Preview and navigate priority topics on your site

## **Usage**

### **Usability Guidance**

* Highlight the primary topics of your website. Help visitors understand what content they can expect to find before they start browsing your site.
* Use succinct labels of 1-2 words in length for each navigation link.
* Use universal language everyone understands.
* Consult web analytics to understand which topics matter most to your visitors.
* Prioritize the needs of site users over internal stakeholders. Navigation is for site users, not your Dean or Vice Chancellor.
* Help people find what they need rather than promoting things they don't.
* If you need to highlight things like a widely publicized report or conference, do so within the body of your website. Navigation links are intended for evergreen content.

* Avoid acronyms, abbreviation, institutional or technical jargon if it is not widely known by site visitors.
* Stick to broad topics or categories.

## **Breadcrumbs**

Breadcrumbs provide an important method of navigating the site. They may feel redundant if your site structure and menus are relatively simple, but they have multiple benefits and require minimal space. We recommend any website with 3 or more levels of page hierarchy (e.g. Home / Academics / Undergraduate) implement breadcrumbs and the wayfinding abilities they provide.

Most visitors will find your site via search engines. If searching for a topic more specific than your program alone, they will likely bypass your homepage to an internal sub-page of your site. Letting visitors know where they entered, and how to na## **Side Menus**
