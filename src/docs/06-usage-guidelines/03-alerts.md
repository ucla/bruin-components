title: Alerts
---
{{render '@support'}}

Notify users of an important change or new piece of information.

## **Usage**

### **Usability Guidance**

* Use alerts to validate steps taken by users or denote a system change.
* Use alerts sparingly. Show one at a time to avoid overwhelming users.
* Be polite and encouraging, and inform users how to respond to or fix a problem.

### **Code Guidance**

* Be sure to include the default "alert" classname in addition to a specific "alert" classname. This will allow the element to inherit default alert styles.
* Alerts will take the full width of the container.
* Adding the "inline-block" classname to an alert element will allow for usage of an alert element that only takes the width of the text content of the alert.

### **Accessibility Requirements**

* Design alerts to visually contrast with surrounding content.
* Use a high-contrast outline or background color and an icon for high visibility.
* Use the ARIA `role="alert"` to notify assistive technology of time-sensitive information.
