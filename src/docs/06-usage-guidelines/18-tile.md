{{render '@support'}}

Large, descriptive link with optional ambient image.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Usability Guidance</h3>

* Use plain language when writing headlines and descriptions.
* Avoid technical language, acronyms or jargon people don't understand.
* Front-load the first 2 words of your headlines for [easy eye scanning](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-2-words-a-signal-for-scanning/).
* Limit headlines to 1 phrase or 2 lines -- there is a suggested 32 maximum character limit.
* Use original images rather than stock images to maintain credibility and trust among your users.

<h3>Accessibility Requirements</h3>

* Link the tile's headline, heading or title to provide the most succinct description to screen readers and search engines. Both technologies use links to understand and navigate document structure.
* Avoid using generic headlines like "read more" or "view details".
* Only use one link per tile.
