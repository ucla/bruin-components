### Principles

**Be clear.**

Make design decisions based on user needs. Design interfaces that help our users accomplish their goals quickly and easily. 

**Be flexible.**

Our design system is for all types of IU applications, even ones that have yet to be imagined. We need to design and build for flexibility.

**Be productive.**

Done is better than perfect. Iteration is only half the battle. Testing with users could reveal issues or questions we didnâ€™t anticipate.

**Be ADA Compliant.**

As an organization we need to be ADA compliant. All branches that are merged into the master branch must be ADA complaint.
