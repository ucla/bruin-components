The Content Creator – This is someone who will be updating the UCLA website with a version of the library installed. They probably know HTML and how to copy paste their own words into a table or place an image. This person is not considered a developer and would not always be the one who installs the library, but still uses the website and updates content.

The Developer – This is coder.  This is someone who could install and use the library on a UCLA website. The more experienced developer could also contribute newly built components or submit bug fixes to the core code.
